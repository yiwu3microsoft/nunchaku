## Overview

![teaser](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/teaser.jpg)
**Nunchaku** is a high-performance inference engine for low-bit neural networks. It implements **SVDQuant**, a post-training quantization technique for 4-bit weights and activations that well maintains visual fidelity. On 12B FLUX.1-dev, it achieves 3.6× memory reduction compared to the BF16 model. By eliminating CPU offloading, it offers 8.7× speedup over the 16-bit model when on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, 3× faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline. On PixArt-∑, it demonstrates significantly superior visual quality over other W4A4 or even W4A8 baselines. "E2E" means the end-to-end latency including the text encoder and VAE decoder.

## Method

#### Quantization Method -- SVDQuant

![intuition](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/intuition.gif)Overview of SVDQuant. Stage1: Originally, both the activation $\boldsymbol{X}$ and weights $\boldsymbol{W}$ contain outliers, making 4-bit quantization challenging. Stage 2: We migrate the outliers from activations to weights, resulting in the updated activation $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and weights $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$. While $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ becomes easier to quantize, $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ now becomes more difficult. Stage 3: SVDQuant further decomposes $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ into a low-rank component $\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ and a residual $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}-\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ with SVD. Thus, the quantization difficulty is alleviated by the low-rank branch, which runs at 16-bit precision.

#### Nunchaku Engine Design

![engine](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/engine.jpg) (a) Naïvely running low-rank branch with rank 32 will introduce 57% latency overhead due to extra read of 16-bit inputs in *Down Projection* and extra write of 16-bit outputs in *Up Projection*. Nunchaku optimizes this overhead with kernel fusion. (b) *Down Projection* and *Quantize* kernels use the same input, while *Up Projection* and *4-Bit Compute* kernels share the same output. To reduce data movement overhead, we fuse the first two and the latter two kernels together.

## Performance

![efficiency](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/efficiency.jpg)SVDQuant reduces the 12B FLUX.1 model size by 3.6× and cuts the 16-bit model's memory usage by 3.5×. With Nunchaku, our INT4 model runs 3.0× faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline on both desktop and laptop NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. Notably, on the laptop 4090, it achieves a total 10.1× speedup by eliminating CPU offloading. Our NVFP4 model is also 3.1× faster than both BF16 and NF4 on the RTX 5090 GPU.
